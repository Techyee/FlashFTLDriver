top down method analyze

remember that master_processor mp is initialized at the top

1. inf_init -> interface initialization
    initialize flying and condition lock
    initialize processors(currently 1 processor)
    initialize queue allocated for each processors

    queue includes req_q, req_rq, retry_q
    qmanager is redblack tree.

    initialize processor thread, each of them initiates p_main

    layer_info_mapping : assign mp's functions with defined ones.

    1-1. p_main
    inf_req pointer made
    _this points to mp.processor
    thread_name specified

    goes into while loop

    functions in atomic way
    -> cl_grap for atomicity, 
    -> use get_next_request function to get I/O request.
    -> cl_release when there's no request(continue)
    -> if request exist, initiate algorithm layer function with inf_req

    repeat this while loop until there's stopflag.


2. bench_init -> _master and bitmap is initialized.
    what is master?
    I think it's place for benchmark system meatadata
    includes monitor, bench_meta, bench_data, lower_info


3. bench_add -> static int idx 선언
    마스터 구조체에 밴치마크 정보를 입력하는 과정.

4. 이후 get_bench()를 통해서 value를 따오고, 따온 value를 계속해서 inf_make_req를 통해 리퀘스트를 만들어서 내려보낸다.

4-1. get_bench
